Slot
====

Slot objects are placeholders that occupy unused slots in the
:ref:`kor-object-table`.  They generally behave like the :ref:`Null object
<kor-null>`, but can be donated to a Memory object's :ref:`memory-method-split`
method to create new objects, whereas the Null object cannot be destroyed.


Branding
--------

Slot key brands are ignored.
