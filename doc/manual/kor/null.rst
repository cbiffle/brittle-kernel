.. _kor-null:

Null
====

The Null object is the target of revoked keys.  It refuses all IPC with
exceptions.

There is one Null object, created by the kernel during :ref:`boot <boot>`.  It
cannot be duplicated or destroyed.  This is the main difference between the
Null object and :ref:`kor-slot`.


Message Elision Rule
--------------------

Messages to Null inside the kernel may be elided.  Because a message to Null
has no observable effect, message elision is not directly observable except in
terms of timing.

This does not apply to message sends initiated by programs inhabiting
:ref:`Contexts <kor-context>`, only sends originating *inside* the kernel that
do not carry reply keys, specifically:

- Messages generated by :ref:`kor-interrupt` objects.
- The reply transmitted by any kernel object in response to a method invocaiton.

In either of these cases:

- If a kernel object is preparing to send a message to key K, and
- It discovers that K refers to the Null Object,
- It *may* discard the message without sending.
