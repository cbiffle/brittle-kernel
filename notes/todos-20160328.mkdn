Open TODOs

Restricting Gate Rights
-----------------------

Currently, any gate key can be used to both send and receive.  This means that a
client could intercept messages intended for a server.  This is obviously wrong.

The easiest fix would be to dedicate some of the bits in the brand of a gate key
to access control.  We should be able to issue gate keys that are limited in the
following ways:
- Unable to receive.
- Unable to send errors (i.e. cannot simulate the revocation of a receive gate
  key).
- Maybe unable to send?  This would let us restrict servers further.
- Unable to add to a group?

My current inclination is to reserve the top 32 bits of the gate brand for
potential system use.  I can always loosen this later.


Gate Groups
-----------

AKA muxes, in my notes.

See `notes-20160324.mkdn` for more details.


Rebooting
---------

I've hoped that we'd be able to "reboot" objects in-place, by resetting any
internal state and revving the generation number in the object table.  This is
critical for having surgical reboots of systems built out of kernel objects.

We need to figure out the correct semantics for reboots, and audit the existing
kernel object implementations for any reboot-related issues, such as potential
dangling pointers.

One biggie would be ensuring that anyone blocked on a rebooted object gets
resumed with a consistent exception.


Support for allocation/deallocation
-----------------------------------

It may be desirable to extend the kernel to support online allocation and
deallocation of objects.  I've avoided it so far because it scares me.

There may be cases in the existing design where allocation/deallocation could be
problematic, e.g. potential dangling pointers.  Find these, fix them.

One would want to keep a particular eye out for raw object pointers.

It may also be desirable to revoke keys during destructor execution.


Prioritization
--------------

We'll want to be able to change the priority of prioritizable objects (Contexts
and Interrupts being the big ones).  This may mean re-collating any lists that
contain the objects.  Make sure this happens in the right places.


App Info Block
--------------

We'd like to separate the 'zoo' from the kernel, so that the kernel can be
compiled with much less knowlege of the application internals.  For this purpose
I've proposed an "app info block" that would be interpreted by the kernel on
startup.  This needs to be designed and implemented.


Faulting
--------

A fault in unprivileged code running in a Context should be translated into a
message from the Context to a (configurable) supervisory object.  Note that the
faulted Context cannot simply resume before action is taken, so it may need to
be placed into a new state (other than `sending`).

Consider the use case of a Context acting as an asynchronous message sender
without actually being runnable (i.e. having no actual stack allocated).


Interrupt delivery failures
---------------------------

Decide whether Interrupt objects should try to notify a supervisory object if
their target key refuses message delivery.  (Sort of like a fault.)


Non-Blocking receive
--------------------

Should a Context be able to request a non-blocking receive?  Should it be able
to make the receive phase of a call non-blocking?


AddressRange advanced validation
--------------------------------

Should AddressRange check the memory ordering and cache policy bits of its keys?
